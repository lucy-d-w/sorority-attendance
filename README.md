#Assignment 5: Sorority Attendance Assistant

In this project, our task is to create a text messaging application that will help a segment of the Vanderbilt community. My project is a solution that makes it easier for busy people to keep track of their sorority commitments. 

For background, sororities have complicated attendance policies. In my sorority, we have weekly chapter meetings, as well as philanthropy events, recruitment meetings, workshops, and social events. Most of these meetings are unnecessary, as announcements drone on and much of the information could easily be conveyed through emails. As a result, people do not want to attend, especially because as Vanderbilt students, we all have a lot of other work we need to prioritize instead. To prevent an attendance problem, we must send in valid excuses to Standards (an individual assigned to enforce rules) and CC the individuals involved in the planning of each event. In addition, there are deadlines as to when excuses need to be submitted, which are different for every event. If an individual misses an event and does not have a valid excuse submitted before the deadline, they must pay a fine, which could be anywhere from $10 to $200 depending on how important the executive board and advisors deem the event to be. Because there are so many events and so many deadlines, and because certain events are announced weeks or even months in advance, it is very difficult to keep track of everything going on. 

After consolidating common complaints from interviews with three sorority members, I have decided to address this problem through an application that will help sorority members keep track of events and deadlines for excuses. This interface should also be able to provide the information necessary to assist in the decision-making process regarding whether or not the individual is going to attend the event. After a decision is made not to attend an event, the interface should be able to provide the contact information of relevant parties and help the user quickly submit standard excuses. 

In terms user interaction paths, the user should not only be able to address events as they come up (typical way), but should also be able to plan ahead. For the traditional decision making path, the user should be able to text the application asking for a list of the week’s events. In response, the application should provide the week’s events. Then, the user should be able to select a specific event and ask for information to help her decide whether or not to attend. For example, the user could ask for the deadline to see if she is even allowed to still submit an excuse, or she could ask how much it will cost her in fines if she has an unexcused absence for the event. Another thing users care about is who will be at the event, so if she asks this question, the application should send texts to a list of her closest friends to inquire about their potential attendance. Then, the application should text the user back with a list of all her friends who will be attending. If the user decides not to attend, she should be able to enter an excuse, which the application will incorporate in an email to all relevant parties. To allow for planning in advance, the application should notify the user of deadlines for excuses as they approach and allow the user to enter the “event declination” pathway from that point.

# Answers:

## How do you feel about the number of sorority and Greek life events you need to attend monthly? 
A: “They tend to be more than necessary. So.. I think the same amount of information that is relayed through five meetings could be relayed in two. Kind of like … there are not enough efficient meetings.”
B: “Oh WAY too many.”
C:  “I feel very overwhelmed by the sheer number of events that I have to attend instead of going to things I find interesting and that are relevant to what I want to learn.”

## How often do you attend sorority events?
A: “I attend everything that’s mandatory, and like, if I have a busy week, sorority events tend to be the first thing that I cut.”
B: “Fairly infrequently. Approximately 2 per month.”
C: “Depending on my stress level, I can attend 0 to 5 sorority events in a week. On average once a week.”


## Do you ever not know where you need to be and when in regards to sorority activities? If yes, what do you do to resolve that?
A: “Umm … yes. I don’t tend to figure out where to be and when until very close to when the event starts. I tend to look at the groupme or text a friend.”
B: “Omg all the time lucy these are such good questions. To resolve it, I unfortunately have to go find emails with chapter announcements. Mostly I just freak out and send it to groupme, which wastes everyone’s time. I just want a text that reminds me where I need to be. I don’t want to do it on calendar.” 
C: “I frequently get confused on what’s happening because we get like so many emails that it becomes numb. To resolve it, I usually rely on group message and other people talking about things.”

## What does your decision making process look like when you decide whether or not to attend an event?
A: “It depends on my level of stress for the week, whether I have something going on at the same time. I tend to choose anything else over chapter. It depends on whether the people I like in the sorority are going to the event. Depends on what the event is and the duration of the event.” 
B: “Distance for sure, time that it will take, my interest level, the punishment associated with me not going, who's going to be there that I like, things of that nature… yeah”
C: “Do I have homework? Do I have time? I would rather swipe and dash than pay the fine. Will I enjoy myself?”

## What is the logistical process you go through after you decide not to attend?
A: “I look at the deadline for excuses and then send an excuse to whoever the appropriate contact is. If it is related to another position, I’ll send an excuse to them too. If the fine is too large to be worth missing, I’ll go.”
B: “Um emailing Jenna that i'm not coming, um and usually making up an excuse,mostly that I have work. ‘Last minute thing has come up for work, I have to be there, sorry!’ I ask jenna what the fine will be … f it’s ridiculous, I’ll go because econ forces, but even then, I might just do test bank work [one form of working off a fine].”
C: “I have to send an email with a good excuse. I think that’s it. Make sure I follow the deadlines for the excuses.”

## Which events are most important for you to attend (mandatory)?
A: “Anything associated with our probation right now is mandatory. Anything they force us to sign up for a shift for I feel obligated to attend. Recruitment related events are super mandatory.”
B: “Umm that thing with being in trouble like all the probation events. Mandatory things like if a date party is going to be taken from me, then I’ll go. Recruitment because they are obnoxious about it. things if I'm not there it’s going to harm others I'll go.”
C: “Hmmm anything regarding certification and maintaining my membership.”

## Which events do you care the most/least about? 
A: “The ones I care the most about are the ones that someone I really like is putting on the event. Also something where I know it’ll be fun or a low time commitment or if there’s food. My least favourite events to attend are anything that’s like a seminar that doesn’t really relate to my life, like those workshops or chapter where we could just get the information in an email.”
B: “Least about chapter. Most about date parties”
C: “I care the most about social bonding events. I care the least about rules and logistics meetings.”

## What is your biggest pain point in terms of attendance policies?
A: “The fact that there are fines associated with missing events is a little extreme. I feel like it would also be easier if there were a running list of excuse deadlines.” 
B: “How strict they are. I should just be able to come and go as I please. I don't know why you’re controlling my whole life, get off my back. Legitimate excuses versus illegitimate excuses. I should be able to say I’m too busy with school work and can’t come.”
C: “I have to keep up with everything that’s going on. My planner doesn’t have room for all those things.”

## What are your most common reasons for missing events?
A: “If I have meetings at the same time, or like if I am really busy with school work.”
B: “Work. Too much work. Would rather be doing something else”
C: “Too busy, stressed, and want to study for a class.”

## If you could choose one thing to improve about your interaction with Greek life attendance policies, what would it be?
A:  “I guess if it could be easier to send in excuses. Like a more centralized location, such as a form, instead of figuring out who you need to CC and when you need to send it by.”
B: “Way less strict, work needs to be a valid excuse that people respect, no punishments for missing things that aren’t mandatory. I would say I want to have the list of when all the events are and I should automatically put in which I won’t go to and I want all those excuses to be sent automatically. I want ready-to-go emails. I could just look at the whole year and send them at appropriate intervals because I was never intending on going from day one. As events pop up, if I could just say yes or no, that would be great.”
C: “I would just have to be more organized with what’s going on and have a separate calendar for it. I’d need to send excuses earlier.”
