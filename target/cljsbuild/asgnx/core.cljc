  "
    This function orchestrates the processing of incoming messages

    The basic flow to handle a message is as follows:

    1. Create the router that will be used later to find the
       function to handle the message
    2. Parse the message
    3. Load any saved state that is going to be needed to process
       the message (e.g., querying the list of experts, etc.)
    4. Find the function that can handle the message
    5. Call the handler function with the state from #3 and
       the message
    6. Run the different actions that the handler returned...these actions
       will be bound to different implementations depending on the environemnt
       (e.g., in test, the actions aren't going to send real text messages)
    7. Return the string response to the message
